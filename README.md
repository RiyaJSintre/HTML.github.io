# HTML.github.io
In this project, I developed a static webpage using only HTML. It includes core elements like headings, lists, tables, images, and forms with text fields and buttons. This project demonstrates my understanding of semantic HTML, accessibility with alt text, and building structured webpages without CSS or JavaScript.
